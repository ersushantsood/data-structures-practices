### TRIE Data Structure : Suitable for Prefix matching , string search . Same prefix strings will have same ancestral nodes.

* Definition from Wiki : In computer science, a trie, also called digital tree or prefix tree,[1] is a type of k-ary search tree, a tree data structure used for locating specific keys from within a set. 
  These keys are most often strings, with links between nodes defined not by the entire key, but by individual characters. In order to access a key (to recover its value, change it, or remove it), 
  the trie is traversed depth-first, following the links between nodes, which represent each character in the key.
